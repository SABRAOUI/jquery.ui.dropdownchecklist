===========

Dropdown Check List is a javascript plugin for the jQuery library that
transforms a regular select HTML element into a dropdown checkbox list.

This code is a fork of the [dropdown-check-list plugin](http://code.google.com/p/dropdown-check-list/) created by
[Adrian Tosca](http://aleris.wordpress.com/). All credit goes to him.

This fork builds on that work, only by adding a few small features. If someday Adrian stumbles across this and likes the idea behind these changes, maybe he'll merge them back into his master and I'll discontinue this fork. The only real reason for this fork is as an expedient way to extend this plugin for some of my own immediate needs.
